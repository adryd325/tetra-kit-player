### Tetra Kit Player

TKP is web application that streams events and files produced by [tetra-kit](https://gitlab.com/larryth/tetra-kit/). 

It's like a PVR for tetra-kit. You can pause the live stream re-listen to old messages search, sort, download them.

Also it features small live CMCE indicator (top right).
